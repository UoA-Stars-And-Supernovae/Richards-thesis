This repository houses the GIFs and code from Richards, 2021.

## Filename Convention

GIFs have the naming convention `evolving_cube_{kick}_{alpha}_{beta}.gif`, where {kick} is either `Bray` or `Hobbs`. Since the Hobbs kick doesn't take alpha or beta parameters, it is coded to be `evolving_cube_Hobbs_0_0.gif`.
